# P2P Networking in the Mina Rust Node

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Mina Rust Node's
peer-to-peer networking implementation, covering the design goals, architecture,
and key features that enable secure, scalable, and decentralized communication.

## Design Goals

In blockchain networks, particularly in Mina, **security**,
**decentralization**, **scalability**, and **eventual consistency** (in that
order) are crucial. The Mina Rust Node's P2P design achieves these goals while
building on Mina Protocol's existing architecture.

### Security

Security in the P2P layer primarily focuses on **DDOS Resilience**, which is the
primary concern for peer-to-peer networks.

Main strategies for achieving security:

1. **Early Malicious Actor Detection**: Protocol design enables quick
   identification of malicious actors so they can be punished (disconnected,
   blacklisted) with minimal resource investment. Individual messages are small
   and verifiable, avoiding resource allocation before processing.

2. **Resource Fairness**: Single peers or groups cannot consume a large chunk of
   resources. The protocol itself enforces fairness across all peers.

3. **Connection Flood Protection**: Malicious peers cannot flood the network
   with incoming connections, preventing legitimate peers from connecting.

### Decentralization and Scalability

Mina Protocol's consensus mechanism and recursive zk-SNARKs enable lightweight
full clients, allowing anyone to run a full node (demonstrated with the Web
Node). While excellent for decentralization, this increases P2P network load and
requirements.

The design supports hundreds of active connections to:

- Increase fault tolerance
- Maintain scalability
- Minimize network [diameter](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphDiameter.html)
- Reduce message latency across the network

### Eventual Consistency

All nodes in the network should eventually reach the same state (same best tip,
transaction/snark pools) without crude rebroadcasts.

## Transport Layer

The Mina Rust Node uses WebRTC as the primary transport protocol for
peer-to-peer communication. WebRTC provides several advantages for security and
decentralization:

- **NAT Traversal**: Built-in support for connecting peers behind NAT routers
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption by default
- **Browser Support**: Enables Web Node functionality
- **Direct Connections**: Reduces dependency on centralized infrastructure

For detailed information about WebRTC implementation, see the
[WebRTC Implementation Guide](webrtc).

## Poll-Based P2P Architecture

Traditional push-based approaches (like libp2p GossipSub) make it practically
impossible to achieve the design goals outlined above. Push-based systems suffer
from:

- Message queues that can't be processed faster than they're received
- Message expiration before processing
- Infinite queue growth requiring message dropping
- Broken eventual consistency from dropped messages
- Security vulnerabilities from uncontrolled resource allocation

### Long Polling Approach

The Mina Rust Node implements a poll-based approach resembling
[long polling](https://www.pubnub.com/guides/long-polling/):

**Core Principle**: Instead of peers flooding with messages, recipients must
request (send permits) for peers to send messages. This gives recipients control
over the flow, enabling:

1. **Fairness Enforcement**: Mentioned in scalability design goals
2. **System Protection**: Previous messages must be processed before requesting
   the next

### Benefits

**Simplified Implementation**: Eliminates complexity around message queues,
overflow handling, message dropping, and recovery mechanisms.

**Eventual Consistency**: Senders have guarantees that sent messages were
processed if followed by a request for the next message. This enables senders to
reason about peer state and adjust messages accordingly.

## Implementation Details

### Connection Establishment

WebRTC connections require exchanging **Offer** and **Answer** messages through
a process called **Signaling**. The Mina Rust Node supports multiple signaling
methods:

#### HTTP API Signaling

- Dialer sends HTTP request containing the offer
- Receives answer if peer accepts connection
- Returns error if connection is rejected
- Required for seed nodes to enable initial connections

#### Relay Signaling

- Dialer discovers listener peer via relay peer
- Relay peer facilitates message exchange between both parties
- Direct connection established after signaling
- Relay peer no longer needed after connection
- **Preferred for security**: No public port exposure, prevents connection
  flooding

### Communication Channels

The Mina Rust Node uses different
[WebRTC DataChannels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDataChannel)
for each protocol, providing isolation and optimized handling:

1. **SignalingDiscovery** - Peer discovery via existing connections
2. **SignalingExchange** - Signaling message exchange via relay peers
3. **BestTipPropagation** - Consensus state + block hash propagation (full
   blocks fetched via RPC)
4. **TransactionPropagation** - Transaction info propagation (full transactions
   fetched by hash via RPC)
5. **SnarkPropagation** - SNARK work info propagation (full SNARKs fetched by
   job ID via RPC)
6. **SnarkJobCommitmentPropagation** - Decentralized SNARK work coordination
   (implemented but unused)
7. **Rpc** - Specific data requests from peers
8. **StreamingRpc** - Large data transfer in small verifiable chunks (e.g.,
   staged ledger reconstruction)

**Request-Response Model**: Each channel requires receiving a request before
sending a response, maintaining the poll-based architecture.

### Efficient Pool Propagation

The Mina Rust Node achieves scalable, eventually consistent, and efficient pool
propagation by leveraging the poll-based approach:

#### Consistency Strategy

1. **Sync Verification**: Only send pool messages when peer's best tip equals or
   exceeds our own
2. **Complete Propagation**: Send all pool transactions/SNARKs to newly
   connected peers
3. **Transmission Tracking**: Maintain records of sent messages per peer
4. **Future Enhancement**: Eventual consistency with limited transaction pool
   size (TODO)

#### Data Structure

A special
[distributed pool data structure](https://github.com/o1-labs/mina-rust/blob/develop/core/src/distributed_pool.rs)
efficiently tracks sent messages:

- **Append-Only Log**: Each entry indexed by number
- **Update Strategy**: Remove and re-append at end to update entries
- **Minimal Peer Data**: Only store next message index per peer (initially 0)
- **Sequential Propagation**: Send next message and increment index until
  reaching pool end
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids sending same data twice

## OCaml Node Compatibility

For compatibility with existing OCaml nodes, the Mina Rust Node includes a
[libp2p implementation](libp2p):

- **Inter-Implementation Communication**: OCaml ↔ Rust via LibP2P
- **Intra-Implementation Communication**: Rust ↔ Rust via WebRTC
- **Gradual Migration**: Enables smooth transition as more nodes adopt the Mina
  Rust Node

## Future Enhancements

### Leveraging Local Pools for Smaller Blocks

**Concept**: Use locally stored transactions and SNARKs to reduce block
transmission size.

#### Benefits

1. **Reduced Bandwidth**: Eliminate redundant transmission of known items
2. **Decreased Processing Overhead**: Less parsing and validation of large
   blocks
3. **Memory Optimization**: Avoid duplicate data storage

#### Implementation Considerations

- **SNARK Priority**: Large SNARKs benefit most from this approach
- **Synchronization Requirements**: Assumes consistent local pools across nodes
- **Protocol Modifications**: May require block format changes to reference
  rather than embed items
- **Missing Data Handling**: Fetch only missing pieces when references don't
  match local data

#### Expected Outcome

Smaller block propagation improves scalability, reduces resource usage, and
increases propagation speed across the network.
